Backup is a system utility for Linux and Mac OS X, distributed as a RubyGem, that allows you to easily perform backup
operations. It provides an elegant DSL in Ruby for _modeling_ your backups. Backup has built-in support for various
databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It
was built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.
